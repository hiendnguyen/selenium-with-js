# Setup environment
Basically, you will need below softwares

## NodeJS and npm
To check whether your machine has Node and NPM installed, open a terminal/console window and type:

```npm --versions```

To install Node, latest [LTS version](https://nodejs.org/en/) may be a good starting point.

## MochaJS
[Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) is a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on Node.js and in the browser, making asynchronous testing simple and fun.

## ChaiJS
[Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) is a BDD / TDD assertion library for node and the browser that can be delightfully paired with any javascript testing framework.

## Browser
I understand that we may need to run our tests cross-browsers. For now, please just start with Chrome.

## Selenium Webdriver
To install Webdriver, open a terminal/console window and type:
```
npm install selenium-webdriver
```

## Code Editor or IDE
Well, please stick with your favourite one. For me, I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and/or [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
