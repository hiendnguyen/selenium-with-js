# Setup environment
Basically, you will need below softwares

## NodeJS and npm
To check whether your machine has Node and NPM installed, open a terminal/console window and type:

```npm --versions```

To install Node, latest [LTS version](https://nodejs.org/en/) may be a good starting point.

## Browser
I understand that we may need to run our tests cross-browsers. For now, please just start with Chrome.

## Code Editor or IDE
Well, please stick with your favourite one. For me, I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
